(c) is a **data engineering** problem; while not reflective of the entire data science process, this sort of manipulation of data to get it into a form suitable for analysis is a crucial part of the data science process.

   "source": "However, choice (d) of Exercise 1, as well as examples 1 and 2 from the above list, do fall into the bucket of **machine learning**. What does this mean?\n\n\"Learn\" means to \"gain or acquire knowledge or skill in something via experience.\" So one could frame \"machine learning\" as \"how a machine gains or acquires knowledge via experience.\" How does a machine gain experience? All machine inputs are essentially binary strings of 0s and 1s, which is really just – you guessed it – data! So machine learning is really just **how a computer acquires knowledge via data**.\n\nOf course, this gives no insight into the \"how\" at all; it just says that there is something that is done with input data to generate this knowledge as an output. To make a math analogy, machine learning is some function $f$ such that\n\n> $ knowledge = f(data)$\n\nand other than that there are no other real stipulations on $f$! So $f$ could be as mechanical as a simple mathematical function (say, the sum of all the data points) and qualify as machine learning. And in practice, this is what most of the common machine learning algorithms are, including:\n\n1. Logistic regression\n2. Random forests\n3. Support vector machines\n4. $k$ - means clustering\n5. Neural networks\n\n(You will learn about all of these later in the course.) This may seem disappointing, given how the media hypes up \"artificial intelligence\" and makes it seem like there is something \"smart\" going on with machine learning, but in fact many mechanical methods satisfy the conditions required to be classified as machine learning. This doesn't mean these mechanical methods are limited in usefulness – in fact, they are quite powerful if used properly – but it does mean that they don't resemble anything that we would naturally associate with human-like intelligence.\n\nMore specifically, machine learning is \"mechanical\" in the sense that how these algorithms \"learn\" is strictly based upon mathematical principles. For example, linear regression is an algorithm that learns by adjusting the coefficients of the input data to best predict an output value. How the coefficients change is entirely based on mathematical protocols (in this case, the gradients of the input data). A common application of linear regression would be predicting housing prices based on various input data such as size, number of rooms, and age of the house. The model would take in the data and learn from it by choosing the set of coefficients that minimizes the error of its predictions vs. actual prices.",

Thus, any automated system would likely require a complex model that takes all of these factors into account. Such a model would benefit from incorporating machine learning.",

The most famous aptitude test developed was the [**Turing test**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turing-test-artificial-intelligence/), named after the English mathematician and famous World War II cryptographer Alan Turing. In this exam, there is a human evaluator and two conversation partners: one machine and one human. The evaluator would conduct a conversation with each through a text-only channel. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\nTuring did not explicitly state that his test could be used as a measure of intelligence, but many who came after him thrust his test into the limelight. Of course, the implication is that if a computer can converse like a human, then it is effectively as intelligent as a human.",
